## Development

![Markdown](https://img.shields.io/badge/Markdown-000000?style=for-the-badge&logo=Markdown&logoColor=FFFFFF)

This project uses plain GitHub-flavored Markdown. It's a Jekyll-based GitHub Pages site that deploys to https://blessedjs.jcbhmr.com/. There's not really a good way to preview things locally right now.
